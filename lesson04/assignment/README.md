# Lesson 04 - Transform/Transition Assignment

### Inspiration
- [GROW](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/)
When hovering over the image it will grow slightly. This is a pretty simple transition effect, I modified it by making it grow slightly less than what is outlined here.

- [FADE](http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/cfimg/#cfimg7)
When transitioning between selected images one fades into the next.

I updated this in a couple of ways:
1. I rewrote it using vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery.
2. I used the images themselves for the control, instead of buttons, or span elements used in the example.
3. I added some transitions for when hovering over the controls, so the changes are smooth.
4. I used the figure element, instead of just an image, so there was space to include details about the art piece.

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Research
Find (at least) __one__ example of transition-based animation that you want to include into your final project.  Remember this final project will be part of your portfolio, you want to use it to impress future employers. Implement that transition you found using SCSS, Mixins, and Variables.

### To get started:
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch called `lesson-04` or something like that
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson04/assignment`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `gulp`
- 	Work in the same setup as you're used to, feel free to structure the SCSS at your preference
- 	Make sure that your code runs and the animation works in the browser when finished

### Requirements:
- CSS Animation(s) present is based on transitioning properties, should look smooth
- Use of Sass features (at least 1 mixin and variables)
- Provided inspiration source/source code
- Use of comments in HTML/CSS

### BONUS
- Use BEM style naming in your HTML/CSS
- Extra: Create multiple transition-based animations

### To Submit:
- Create a pull request with YOUR forked master branch as the base, NOT the original. Your assignment branch that was created for this week will be the compare branch
- Add Patrick & Bryce as reviewers
- Submit the pull request link in the assignment submission in Canvas
